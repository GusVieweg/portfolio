[VERSION 1.0.0 - 06-13-2016]

The following is my own personal website listing projects that I have worked on or currently working on, as well as blog posts detailing
certain thoughts I have involved with math, computer science, or my personal life. I hope to add certain features to the site as time
permits including the ability to comment, an RSS feed, sorting based on category of post, etc.
